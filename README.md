# GenePy

This project ports the Eugene framework to Python. Work in progress.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
#### GenePy code

#### GenePy GUI

Genepy GUI requires Tkinter toolkit. There no one definitive way of installing Tkinter. Please surf the web for the method that suites your environment.

### Installing

Clone this repo or download the files. For example:
```
git clone https://github.com/hkim42/GenePy.git
```
will clone the repo.

## Running the tests

### GenePy code

### GenePy GUI

Run the test_gui.py to start off the GUI. Only single line of code is required to start as evident in the script.

The main window will pop up with various widgets for user inputs.

It is recommended to open the console window first because it displays all the rules that are defined by the user along with the output DNA sequences.

Clicking the buttons for adding rules will open another window where the user can enter the parameters pertaining to the rule. There is a button for each of the rules.

Lastly, running the solver will display all possible DNA sequences on the console window. If there are no possible sequences nothing will be added on the console window.

There are spaces for defining the number of parts to be used and the number of solutions the user desires. When the button for running the solver is pressed, these values will be passed into the code backend.
